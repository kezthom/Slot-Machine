About:
A fruit based slot machine. Each play costs 1 credit. If the value of the second line of fruits is the same on all three slot section, player win 10 points. Game continues until user quits or runs out of credit

How It's Made:

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JS
JS Skills Needed: Arrays, for loops



Optimizations:

When approching this project, my inital method was to include the images in each slot section and toggle a hidden class with each win. While the idea could be executed I realized it was tedious to insert a hidden and display to all images in each slot and that my code would look very cluttered. Additionally, I was trying to include more user input like bet max and insert credit buttons.  I realized that I was overcomplicating things and focused on the core of the project which was to have functional slot displays, that alllowed the user to see their remaining credits and wins. 


Lessons Learned:

Don't overthink. What is the goal of the project and the more simplest way to get there. 

Areas of improvement:

I used arrays for this project, but I am interested in doing exploring this project again without it. Additionally, I would like to add more animation and eventually add a small collection of machines.
